# In this short lesson, we will going over variables in Python.
# What are variables?
# Variables are things that store data values. In Python (unlike other languages) you can define variable by just assigning a value to it.
# For example:
def defineVariable():
    # We define a variable 'x', and assign it the value 5, using the '=' operator
    x = 5
    print("x has a value of: " + x)
    # We can also define a variable as a string using "".
    y = "Deez"
    print("y has a value of: " + y)

    # In Python, as there is no type declaration, a variables type can be changed after being stated.
    z = 25
    print("z has a value of: " + z)
    z = "Deez"
    print("z has a value of: " + z)

    # Try it out yourself, define a variable [a], as a string, and print its value out to the console.
