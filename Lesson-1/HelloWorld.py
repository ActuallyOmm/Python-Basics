# Welcome to the Python beginners guide 
# In this short guide, I will show you the basics to programming in Python.

# Week 1
# In this weeks lesson, we will be going over printing outputs to the console.
# To write an output to the console, use the print() method to do so.

# Hint:
# You'll notice when you type in some text without using either a set of '' or "" you get an error.
# This is because the Python interpreter cannot see the text as a string, and rather a set of undefined variables.


# Task 1:
# In the main function, call the print method similarly to how it has been written below.
# Test: To test whether your solution has worked, run the command: python test.py.

def main():
    print("Like this!!")



main()
